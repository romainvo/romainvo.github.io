# About me

I am PhD student at CEA List and Mines Paris. I work under the supervision of [√âtienne Decenci√®re](https://people.cmm.minesparis.psl.eu/users/decenciere/) at the [Center for Mathematical Morphology](https://www.cmm.minesparis.psl.eu/en/home/), my work is co-supervised by [Caroline Vienne](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/caroline-vienne-4b633783/en) and [Julie Escoda](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/julie-escoda-2a61b522) at the D√©partement d'Instrumentation Num√©rique. The goal of my PhD is to develop novel deep learning algorithms for Sparse-View X-ray Computed Tomography, with mid to long term applications for online control and monitoring. My research interests lie at the intersection of deep learning, inverse problems, generative modeling and optimization. 

Previously, I worked as a Research Engineer at [IDEMIA](https://www.idemia.com/fr), developping deep learning solutions for biometric fraud detection. Before this I graduated from IMT Atlantique with an engineering diploma in Computer Science for decision support.
