# Teaching

During my PhD, I taught classes on deep learning and computed tomography, providing hands-on experience and mentoring students in their research projects.

## Mines Paris & [IASD M.Sc](https://www.masteriasd.eu/fr/) - PSL University
I was a teaching assistant for the course on [Deep Learning for Image Analysis](https://cours.cmm.minesparis.psl.eu/wiki/doku.php/deep/start). The lectures and projects aim at providing theoretical and practical basis on deep learning for image-based applications.

## Mines Paris - [BigMeca](https://bigmeca.minesparis.psl.eu/)
I was a lecturer for the object detection and semantic segmentation classes for the course-intensive week on [Computer vision and machine learning for the material scientist](https://bigmeca.minesparis.psl.eu/computer-vision-and-machine-learning-for-the-material-scientist/). The following slides are largely inspired by [Fei-Fei Li](https://cs231n.stanford.edu/slides/2023/lecture_11.pdf)'s (CS231N) class on Deep Learning for Computer Vision:

- Semantic Segmentation  [<i class="fas fa-chalkboard-teacher"></i>](/files/teaching/cvml/segmentation_v2.pdf)

## Mines Paris - [MAREVA](https://www.cmm.minesparis.psl.eu/mareva/)
I gave lectures on Computed Tomography for Medical and Industrial applications as well as recent advances on deep learning approaches for inverse problems in imaging.
